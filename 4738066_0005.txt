This reei of microtiirn contains materiai
which has paper color changes, stains, or
illustratione, (some of which may appear on
paqes mixed witti printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text and illustrations are
temple, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore‚ when text and illustrations exist
in a single image or when materiai
bacquounds differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure retiects trie camera
operator's best effert to capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure reflects the

camera operator's best effert to capture

iilustrative materiai or the remaining text. it
is hoped that this practice witi result iri a
microfiirrt product that fully serves the needs
of most researchers
